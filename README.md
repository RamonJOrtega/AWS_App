# AWS Marketing App

## What Is It?
This App was created to demonstrate proficiency with serverless, cloud-based microservies, particularly `AWS Lambda` and `AWS API Gateway`.
This App has been updated multiple times as OpenAI continues to deprecate old models.
Go to https://aws-marketing-app.vercel.app/ to try out the App!

If you live in the US near Oregon (AWS US-west-2 ), you can expect results in 2-3 seconds. 
If you live on the East coast, latency can be 8 seconds for the 1st request but will improve the more you use the app.

## How the App Works
- This is a `Saas` (`software as a service`) application.
- The Infrastructure holds an `API` written in `python` using `FastAPI` and contained within `AWS Lambda` service on `AWS API Gateway`.
- The `AWS Lambda` service takes a prompt from a user and makes a call to the 3rd party `OpenAI` `API` which returns keyword results.
- The `AWS Lambda` service is triggered by AWS `API gateway` which recieves the promp from the user client in the form of a UIR provides an endpoint.
- Serving as a proxy, between user client and `AWS Lambda `, `API Gateway` URIs looke like the following:
- https://##mgcbkr##.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/generate_wods?prompt=classy_cocktail. 
- The `AWS Lambda` and `API Gateway` service are maintined via `AWS CDK`.
- All `pip` python dependicies live in a `base layer` (created with `Docker`) within `AWS Lamba` 
  
The user communicates with the backend infrastructure stack via a front end written in `Typscript`, `React`, and `Next.js` which is all hosted on `Vercel`

### `openAI` Model: `GPT-3.5-Turbo`.
- This is the fastsest, lowest cost, GPT model, capable of simple tasks.
- The financial cost of running this app is currently `$0.001`/`1000 tokens` or `$0.005`/`request`
- Each `request` is approximately 31 characters which usually equates to about `13 tokens`
- For `$5`/`month` the will serve approximately `960 requests`s

### Front End Tech Stack
- `Typescript` language
- `NextJS` and `React` main framworks
- `TailwindCSS` styling framework
- `Vercel` hosting

### Back End Tech Stack
- `Python` language
- `FastAPI` framework
- `AWS` `Lambda` and `API Gateway` hosting
- `OpenAI` for content generation
- `AWS CDK` and `Docker` for infrastructure management
- `GitHub` version control 
- `Linux` bash terminal for endpoint testing`
- `Docker` container setup for AWS Service

## Repository File Structure

### /infrastructure
The AWS infrastructure generated by AWS CDK lives in the `/infrastructure` folder.
The `lib` foldercontains `infrastructure as code`.
The `lambda_base_layer` contains the dockerfile and base layer script used to genearate the linux machine configuration that gets deployed to `AWS Lambda`
Every time you make a change to the infrastructure, you need to save and run "cdk deploy" to update the AWS Lambda service on AWS API Gateway.

## /app
The python API and FastAPI backend live in the the `/app` folder.
Update these files to get different responses from Chat GPT on openAI.
Every time you make a change to the app folder, you need to save and run "cdk deploy" to update the AWS Lambda service on AWS API Gateway.

## /brand-helper-site filder
The Next.JS front end lives in the `/brand-helper-site` folder.
Modify these files to change the themes, text, and browser behavior of the app.
Don't forget to push your files to github to auto-update the Vercel Host if you put this on a website.

## To Duplicate this App on your local machine and your own AWS Account
Clone this repo, and make sure you already have `python3`, `Yarn`, and `node` installed. Then duplicate the frontend and backend. 

### Duplicate the frontend:
1. `cd brand-helper-site` folder from the terminal.
2. `yarn install` to install all dependencies
3. Optionally, if you want to make this a webApp, you can host this frontend for free `Vercel.com/docs` -> `quickstart` -> `Next.js` -> `Deploy`.

### Duplicate repo backend:
1. From the main directory, have `node` and `python3` installed.
2. From the main directory, run `pip install fastAPI` , `pip install mangum` and `pip install awscli`
3. Navigate 1 folder down: `cd insfrastructure`. 
4. Run `yarn add aws-cdk-lib` per AWS CDK instructions online.
5. From the main folder, run `sudo npm install -g aws-cdk` to get the cloud developement kit which pushes your code to the server.
6. Create an AWS account, and setup `AWS Lambda` and `AWS API Gateway`.
   -You need to set up an IAM user and generate an access key and secrete key to actually use the CDK through code.
7. Run `yarn add aws-cdk-lib` per AWS CDK instructions online.
8. To get the infrastructure code to your AWS accout, Run `cdk bootsrap aws://<12-digit-aws-accountnumber>/<zone>`. Zone example `<us-west-2>`
9. Navigate to `infrastructure` with `cd infrastructure`. Run `npm build` to build the infrastructure. Note that the rest of the project uses yarn, but the infrastructure folder uses npm which is aws cli native. This entire `infrastructure` folder was intitialized by the Cloud Developement Kit with `cdk init --language typescript`.
10. Run `aws configure` and enter your access key and sectret access key (these are found from your IAM account)
11. Create and save a .env file within the `infrastructure` folder with 1 line of code: `OPEN_API_KEY="xx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. All `.env` files are in the `.gitIgnore` file, but you should double check.
12. To get the `infrastructure-stack.ts` to access the API key within the environment variable, run `yarn add dotenv`.
13. Navigate: `cd infrastructure/lambda_base_layer`.
14. If using `WSL` install docker with `sudo ap install docker.io` in order to prepare dependencies which we will imbedin the lambda base layer. Start docker.
   - (since WSL doesn't have a `systemedd`, run `sudo update-alternateives --config iptables` ans select 1 `iptables-lagacy` 
   - `sudo service docker start` )
15. run `sudo ./generate_base_layer.sh` to run the script to put python and all dependencies on the docker image. This will generate a zip file that you can deploy to the cloud via cdk deploy. Any time you want to add a new dependency to your container, just add thedependency to `/infrastructure/requirements.txt` and re-run `sudo generate_base_layer.sh`, then redeploy `cdk deploy` to AWS.
16. Run `cdk deploy` (creates lambda function on your account and sets up the backend).
